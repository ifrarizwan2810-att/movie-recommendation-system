THIRD-SEMESTER-PROJECT
🎬 Movie Recommendation System (C++)
This is a C++ project that implements a simple hybrid Movie Recommender System. The system suggests similar movies using a combination of graph-based connections and content-based filtering. It’s designed to work with two input text files: one containing connections between movies and the other containing content information such as genre, director, and release year.

📌 Description
The recommender works in two main phases:
Graph-Based Recommendation: It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all movies that are directly or indirectly connected to the given movie. This models relationships between movies like sequels, shared universe, or viewer patterns.
Content-Based Filtering: Once candidate movies are identified via BFS, the program compares each one with the input movie using content features (genre, director, and release year). A similarity score is calculated based on the number of matching attributes.

Top Suggestions: The system then displays the top 3 most similar connected movies based on the content similarity score.

🧾 Files Included
main.cpp – The main source code containing the class definition and recommendation logic.
graph.txt – Text file representing a graph of connected movies (each line contains two movie names).
movies.txt – Text file with movie attributes: movie name, genre, director, and year.
README.md – Documentation file with all necessary instructions and explanation (this file).

📂 File Formats
graph.txt should include pairs of movie names per line to define edges in the graph. Each pair represents a bidirectional connection. Example:
Inception Interstellar Inception Tenet Interstellar Gravity
movies.txt should include four space-separated attributes: movie name, genre, director, and year. Example:
Inception SciFi Nolan 2010
Interstellar SciFi Nolan 2014
Tenet SciFi Nolan 2020
Gravity SciFi Cuaron 2013

⚠ Make sure movie names do not contain spaces unless you modify the code to use getline() instead of cin.

🖥 How to Compile and Run
To run this project, follow these steps:
Open a terminal in the folder containing your .cpp file and data files.
Compile the program using the following command:
g++ MovieRecommender.cpp -o recommender
Run the compiled program:
./recommender # for Linux/macOS recommender.exe # for Windows
When prompted, enter the name of a movie to get recommendations. Example:
Enter a movie name for recommendations: Inception

🧠 How Similarity is Calculated
The content similarity is computed by checking how many attributes match between the input movie and each connected movie. The attributes compared are:
Genre
Director
Year
For each match, one point is added. The similarity score is calculated as:
similarity = (number of matches) / (total attributes)
This means a movie with all 3 attributes matching will have 100% similarity.

📤 Sample Output
Enter a movie name for recommendations: Inception Finding recommendations for Inception... Recommendations for Inception:
Tenet (Similarity: 100%)
Interstellar (Similarity: 66.6667%)
🚀 Features

Combines collaborative filtering (graph-based) and content-based filtering.
Recommends top 3 similar movies.
Uses BFS for graph traversal.
Calculates content similarity based on shared genre, director, and year.
Easy to use with plain text files.

🔧 Possible Future Improvements

Add support for movie names with spaces using getline(cin, movie).
Include additional attributes like actors, ratings, or keywords.
Export recommendations to a separate output file.
Implement a simple graphical interface or web version.
Include user preferences or feedback for personalized results.
