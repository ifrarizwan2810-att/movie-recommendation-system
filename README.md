THIRD-SEMESTER-PROJECT
ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System (C++)
This is a C++ project that implements a simple hybrid Movie Recommender System. The system suggests similar movies using a combination of graph-based connections and content-based filtering. Itâ€™s designed to work with two input text files: one containing connections between movies and the other containing content information such as genre, director, and release year.

ðŸ“Œ Description
The recommender works in two main phases:
Graph-Based Recommendation: It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all movies that are directly or indirectly connected to the given movie. This models relationships between movies like sequels, shared universe, or viewer patterns.
Content-Based Filtering: Once candidate movies are identified via BFS, the program compares each one with the input movie using content features (genre, director, and release year). A similarity score is calculated based on the number of matching attributes.

Top Suggestions: The system then displays the top 3 most similar connected movies based on the content similarity score.

ðŸ§¾ Files Included
main.cpp â€“ The main source code containing the class definition and recommendation logic.
graph.txt â€“ Text file representing a graph of connected movies (each line contains two movie names).
movies.txt â€“ Text file with movie attributes: movie name, genre, director, and year.
README.md â€“ Documentation file with all necessary instructions and explanation (this file).

ðŸ“‚ File Formats
graph.txt should include pairs of movie names per line to define edges in the graph. Each pair represents a bidirectional connection. Example:
Inception Interstellar Inception Tenet Interstellar Gravity
movies.txt should include four space-separated attributes: movie name, genre, director, and year. Example:
Inception SciFi Nolan 2010
Interstellar SciFi Nolan 2014
Tenet SciFi Nolan 2020
Gravity SciFi Cuaron 2013

âš  Make sure movie names do not contain spaces unless you modify the code to use getline() instead of cin.

ðŸ–¥ How to Compile and Run
To run this project, follow these steps:
Open a terminal in the folder containing your .cpp file and data files.
Compile the program using the following command:
g++ MovieRecommender.cpp -o recommender
Run the compiled program:
./recommender # for Linux/macOS recommender.exe # for Windows
When prompted, enter the name of a movie to get recommendations. Example:
Enter a movie name for recommendations: Inception

ðŸ§  How Similarity is Calculated
The content similarity is computed by checking how many attributes match between the input movie and each connected movie. The attributes compared are:
Genre
Director
Year
For each match, one point is added. The similarity score is calculated as:
similarity = (number of matches) / (total attributes)
This means a movie with all 3 attributes matching will have 100% similarity.

ðŸ“¤ Sample Output
Enter a movie name for recommendations: Inception Finding recommendations for Inception... Recommendations for Inception:
Tenet (Similarity: 100%)
Interstellar (Similarity: 66.6667%)
ðŸš€ Features

Combines collaborative filtering (graph-based) and content-based filtering.
Recommends top 3 similar movies.
Uses BFS for graph traversal.
Calculates content similarity based on shared genre, director, and year.
Easy to use with plain text files.

ðŸ”§ Possible Future Improvements

Add support for movie names with spaces using getline(cin, movie).
Include additional attributes like actors, ratings, or keywords.
Export recommendations to a separate output file.
Implement a simple graphical interface or web version.
Include user preferences or feedback for personalized results.
